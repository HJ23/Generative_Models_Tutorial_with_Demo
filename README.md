# Generative Models Tutorial
Generative models are interesting topic in ML. Generative models are a subset of unsupervised learning that generate new sample/data by using given some training data. There are different types of ways of modelling same distribution of training data: Auto-Regressive models, Auto-Encoders and GANs. In this tutorial, we are focusing theory of generative models, demonstration of generative models, important papers, courses related generative models. It will continue to be updated over time.

**Keywords:**  Generative Models, Variational Auto Encoders (VAE), Generative Adversial Networks (GAN), VAE/GAN papers, courses, etc..

**NOTE: This tutorial is only for education purpose. It is not academic study/paper. All related references are listed at the end of the file.**
